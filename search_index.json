Some teams have members that have never touched an ounce of HTML, while some others have members dedicated to writing a wiki. Regardless, there are many obstacles that will be faced in the process of making a wiki whether you are a novice or professional at programming on the client-side. We have compiled a list of important things to know before you start going with your wiki. This book assumes you have some knowledge of programming in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (optional). Additionally, this book will also teach those on the Washington iGEM team how to work with the JavaScript created from the previous yearsâ€™ wiki. This message will self-destruct if we make this tutorial public for the rest of iGEM. "],
